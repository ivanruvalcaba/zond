# Vostok
Running concurrently to NASA's project Mercury, the Soviet *Vostok*, or if you
prefer the original Russian, *Восток* project was a human spaceflight program
with the goal of putting the first human into low earth orbit and returning them
safely. Yuri Gagarin in fact became the first human to do so on April 12th, 1961.

In this context, Vostok is a static gemini capsule generator, think static site
generator like Hugo or Jekyll but for [Project Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space).
